## Lily-forces
Codeforces has a feature of hacking, during contests. Here hacking doesnâ€™t mean illegitimately breaking into a computer system.
In hacking you can view the solution of others. If you think that you have a test case where the code may give wrong answer. Just click on hack and provide your test case.

Hacking is very good, because it teaches you to read and understand others code, which is a very important quality, every programmer must possess.
